This is a patch by Peng@FinalFrontier adding a JSON parser package to the
driver.

Submitted as https://ldmud.eu/mantis/view.php?id=724

Peng@FF submitted this patch for adding their string compiler to the
driver. As it is completely undocumented, we do not include it in our
driver documentation, but add it to ldmud-extensions. Maybe someone
will work on it there.
