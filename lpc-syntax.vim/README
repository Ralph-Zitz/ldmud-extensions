lpc.vim is a syntax definition file for the programming language LPC.

As there are different variants/dialects of LPC, this file is specially
adapted to the syntax used by LDMud-3.5.x (https://ldmud.eu/)

It includes many lfuns defined by the base mudlib of the MUD MorgenGrauen.

Usage:
  * Please install it either in the system-wide syntax/ directory
    (e.g. /usr/share/vim/vim71/syntax)
    or in
    ~/.vim/syntax/
  * Add to your .vimrc:
      syntax on
      autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead <mudlib-directory>/*.[c|h] set filetype=lpc
  * It you don't use a MorgenGrauen-based mudlib, exchange the content of 
    'syn keyword lpcEfun ...' with your own lfun list.

The syntax file is compatible with VIM 7.0, 7.1.
