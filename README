This is a collection of unofficial patches/extensions/packages for
LDMud - an LPC Gamedriver.

Although this repository is hosted and organized by the maintainers of LDMud,
please keep in mind: these patches may be only cursorily tested or even not at
all. If they are tested, this is done by their contributors and their users.
They may work with your specific version/release of LDMud or they may not.
They may introduce instabilities, crashes or weird behaviour to LDMud.

We (the maintainers of LDMud) usually can't offer support for these packages
here and will probably have no time to debug crashes in LDMud if patched with
the patches contained here.

Therefore: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


License issues
==============
The repository does not enforce a specific license. Each patch may have their
own license/conditions depending on the contributors / copyright holders - as
long as it is an open source license as defined by the Open Source Initiative.
For a list of candidates, go to: http://www.opensource.org/licenses

However, if a patch should ever be included in the official driver, it is
required to be licensed under the 2-clause BSD license as given in 
COPYING.template. Therefore we strongly encourage contributors to use this 
license for all patches contributed here.
